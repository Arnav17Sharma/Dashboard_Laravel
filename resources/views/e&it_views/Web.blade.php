                                            In-house mobile app and web portal has been developed by CHIPs under the
                                            BuildNext project for the calculation of OBC and economically weaker
                                            sections in the population of the state. The mobile app 'CGQDC' (WFC)
                                            prepared by Chips for calculation is available in the Chips Play Store,
                                            which can be downloaded and uploaded in the prescribed format. Apart from
                                            this, information can also be entered in the Choice Center through the web
                                            portal Prunbahukbandapada.
                                            <br>
                                            For the survey, 5549 supervisors have been appointed in the entire state,
                                            out of which 1103 supervisors have been appointed in urban areas and 4446
                                            supervisors in gram panchayat areas. For registration, four login options
                                            have been given in the app â€“ Aadhar card, ration card number, mobile number
                                            of the head of the ration card or mobile number of the applicant. After
                                            login, the information related to the applicant will have to be uploaded in
                                            the form of the app. The uploaded information will be automatically
                                            forwarded to the supervisor appointed for the ward of the concerned
                                            applicant's Gram Panchayat, Nagar Panchayat or urban body. The authorized
                                            supervisor will verify the same. After that the data will be saved in the
                                            server. This data will be helpful in the calculation of Other Backward
                                            Classes and Economically Weaker Sections of the state.
